<p>TheTalentClub  is a service that connects talent with clients.</p>

<p>You need to connect with the right kind of talent to meet your needs and artists need the right platform to showcase their talent.</p>

<p>At TheTalentClub , our goal is not merely connecting artists with their fans, we also actively strive at bettering and developing the entire ecosystem and aim to introduce transparency in the entire process, both online and off it, in the physical world.</p>

<p>For clients we will hand hold you through the entire process right from providing you options on artists, to connecting you to the right vendors, and also executing the entire project for you if need be.</p>

<p>For artists, we aim at building the largest community of artists in the world, and also are planning on introducing features that help you maximise your potential by connecting you with clients and also by figuring out ways to help you raise resources towards your projects. We understand that a lot goes into building an artists' career and are fully committed to helping you as much as possible. </p>

<p>The team behind TheTalentClub  has been instrumental in setting up some of the most popular trends in the country by actively promoting a live scene for music, comedy, independent cinema, theatre, electronic music, poetry, rap, bboying, metal and also handling entertainment programming for some of the most iconic venues in the country. Having had an experience of building and interacting with a community of over 2500 artists, it was but natural for us to commit ourselves to an endeavor like this, as this is something we love doing day in and day out!! </p>
